Hiring Cafe Take Home Challenge Avature Scraper

### Task 1: Discover and define Tenants/potential paths from seed URLs
- Create a Tenant Registry to track tenants and their potential paths
- Avoid Redirect and tracker paths
- Expanded seed URLs using CT, found 28 additional tenants (Expanded approach)
- Seed URLs is already pretty huge, maybe deeper expansion techniques need to be considered to actually expand this further.
